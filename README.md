# CombatPlayground

This project is made to test out my own code library Plugin, [AbilityHelper](https://github.com/joshk418/AbilityHelper) used for quickly setting up GAS functions using a lot of the code styles from Lyra and Stephen Ulibarri's [Unreal Engine 5 - Gameplay Ability System - Top Down RPG](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-gas-top-down-rpg/) course. The project also uses the C++ version of the Advanced Locomotion System originally made by LongmireLocomotion and recreated by [dyanikoglu](https://github.com/dyanikoglu/ALS-Community).

To clone the repo with all of the required submodules, use the recursive flag:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/joshk418/CombatPlayground.git`
